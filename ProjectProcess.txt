Development Process

* Acquire and compile the specifications from the client
* Design the system at a high level (Backend, User site, Admin site)
* Break down the into User Stories -> Tasks
* Design the code using proper / best software patterns while keeping the project modular
* Each task is tracked by two tasks (One for the code itself and one for adequate testing)
* Leaving proper and necessary comments in the code, no "TODO" methods see below for proper documentation of code
* Creating pull requests and only creating a pull request to the development branch. The master branch is only for predetermined milestones
* Have two scrums weekly either before or after class to get up to speed with what everyone else is doing
* Share milestones with the client to show that progress is being made
* Finalize testing and finalize the product
* Final deployment with documentation and troubleshooting



***TESTING***
Each object will have a test file
ex. Variables will be Variables.Test


***CODING STYLE***
Coding Style: Group logical code together
Methods have two spaces in between, logical breaks INSIDE methods have one space
